# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone repository

Simply clone the repository to your local machine:

# using code
git clone https://github.com/rohitsinghcu/Diet-Recall.git

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Simply install the dependencies of the project which creates node_modules:

# using npm
npm install

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

# using npm
npm start

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

# using npm
npm run android
